I will introduce how differential privacy mathematically characterizes the trade-off between the utility of machine learning models and the users' data protection, and give some elements on how DP is computed in practice. Then, I introduce a novel relaxation of local differential privacy (LDP) that naturally arises in fully decentralized algorithms, i.e., when participants exchange information by communicating along the edges of a network graph without central coordinator. This relaxation, that we call network DP (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05326), captures the fact that users have only a local view of the system. I will present some examples proving that Network DP provides an interesting trade-off and paves the way to amplification of privacy based on decentralization for other algorithms.
