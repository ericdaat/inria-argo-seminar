Exponents for the decay of the excess generalization error of kernel ridge regression (KRR) have been reported in various works under the assumption of power-law decay of eigenvalues of the features covariance (a.k.a. source and capacity conditions). These decays were, however, provided for sizeably different setups, namely in the noiseless case with constant regularization and in the noisy optimally regularized case. Intermediary settings have been left substantially uncharted. We unify and extend this line of work, providing characterization of all regimes and excess error decay rates that can be observed in terms of the interplay of noise and regularization. In particular, we show the existence of a transition in the noisy setting between the noiseless exponents to its noisy values as the sample complexity is increased. Finally, we illustrate how this crossover can also be observed on real data sets.
