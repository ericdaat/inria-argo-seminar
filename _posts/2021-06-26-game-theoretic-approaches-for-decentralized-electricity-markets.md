Due to the large-scale integration of renewable and Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), electricity markets are starting to restructure - from centralized to decentralized local market designs, in which agents negotiate bilaterally their energy procurement with their neighbors. We are interested in a peer-to-peer design of a local market, and its properties, which we analyze using the tools of game theory. First, we focus on the communication mechanism (that takes the form of a non-cooperative game) that captures the agents' ability to define the information they want to exchange in such markets with the other participants, while preserving their privacy. Then we consider the interaction between the financial market and the distribution system operator (DSO) that manages the distribution grid (physical level). In both works we analyze the properties of the equilibria (efficiency, uniqueness etc.) and particular effects it has on the strategic behavior of the agents.
