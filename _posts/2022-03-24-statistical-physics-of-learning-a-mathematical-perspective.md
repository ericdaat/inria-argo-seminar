As opposed to the robust upper bounds of statistical learning theory, the statistical physics of disordered systems proposes exact solutions of benchmark models to understand machine learning algorithms. These results, based on the high-dimensional analysis of random designs, often involve methods strongly anchored in non-rigorous ideas of theoretical physics. The goal of this talk is to motivate and give an overview of the core mathematical concepts that are sufficient to form a rigorous intuition of those results. In particular, we will describe the family of approximate message-passing algorithms and discuss how they can be used to study empirical risk minimisation or the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent. We will conclude the talk with a few recent advances on the study of random design models that capture the behaviour of estimators learned from real datasets.
