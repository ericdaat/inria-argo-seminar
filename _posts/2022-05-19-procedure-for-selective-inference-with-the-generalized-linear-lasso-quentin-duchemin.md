Standard tools to conduct statistical inference assume a fixed model. Nevertheless, the analyst often selects a relevant model based on the observed data. In such cases, one needs to account for the selection event to provide valid inference procedures. In this talk, I will provide a friendly introduction to the field of post selection inference, describing in particular exact methods in the Gaussian Linear model. I will then present our methods to provide asymptotically valid post-selection inference procedures in the logistic model.
