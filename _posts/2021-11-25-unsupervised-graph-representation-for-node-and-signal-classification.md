During this talk, I will present two isometric representations that allow discriminating graph signals [3] as well as nodes obtained from large graphs [1, 2]. The idea is to introduce a cascade of unitary operators whose objective is to build relevant invariants. Indeed, combined with a pointwise modulus, those operators demodulate signals in the low-frequency domain which is more amenable for classification tasks. This simple principle is obtained from the graph signal processing literature and allows to obtain a more interpretable representation both for signal classification and node classification. Numerical experiments are conducted on standard datasets and indicate the strength of this method, which is theoretically well-grounded.
