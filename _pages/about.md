# About

The scientific focus of DYOGENE is on geometric network dynamics arising in communications. Geometric networks encompass networks with a geometric definition of the existence of links between the nodes, such as random graphs and stochastic geometric networks. The dynamic may come from the evolution of the network itself, for instance when nodes move or links' states change, and also from dynamical processes running on top of the network, for instance due to queueing dynamics or social interactions. Our motivations for studying these systems stem from many fields of communications where they play a central role, and in particular: message passing algorithms; epidemic algorithms; wireless networks and information theory; device to device networking; distributed content delivery; social and economic networks.
